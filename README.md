Real_Estate_Price_Prediction_Lab
This repository contains the Lab Work 1 project for the Advanced Machine Learning course at Kaunas University of Technology (KTU).

Project Overview
The project focuses on real estate price prediction using machine learning models such as:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Data preprocessing steps, along with model evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ², are included to ensure high model accuracy and performance.

Data
The dataset used in this project is sourced from UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/555/apartment+for+rent+classified.
